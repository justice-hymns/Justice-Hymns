1.Write a Python program to reverse the string "Programming". Print the reversed string.
Hint: Use string slicing or a loop.

2.Create a Python program that takes a user's full name as input and prints the initials in uppercase.
Example: Input: "john doe", Output: "J.D."

3.Write a Python program to check if a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome reads the same forwards
and backward (e.g., "radar", "level"). Hint: Compare the string with its reverse.

4.Create a Python program that asks the user to enter a sentence and counts the number of words in the sentence.
Hint: Use the split() method to break the string into words.
